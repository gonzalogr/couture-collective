Beautifully maintained and impeccably stored, your clothes are delivered to your door whenever you want them, all season long. When the season’s over, it’s time for a whole new wardrobe.

Once five members have bought shares in a particular item, it is considered sold out and will only appear in their private “closets” on the Co.Co. website. After the show, all items are stored and assiduously cared for in between wearings.
